## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Docker
- Kubernetes (Minikube, kind, or cloud provider)
- Terraform

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Clipsify.git
cd Clipsify
```

## Authentication Service

The authentication service is located in `app/auth/`. It is a Python-based microservice designed for secure user authentication.

### Running Locally

1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r app/auth/requirements.txt
    ```
2. Start the server:
    ```bash
    python app/auth/server.py
    ```

### Docker

Build and run the authentication service using Docker:

```bash
cd app/auth
docker build -t clipsify-auth .
docker run -p 5000:5000 clipsify-auth
```

### Kubernetes

Kubernetes manifests are provided in `app/auth/manifests/` for easy deployment.

```bash
cd app/auth/manifests
kubectl apply -f auth-configmap.yaml
kubectl apply -f auth-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f auth-service.yaml
kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml
```

For local development, see `ingress-local.yaml` and `LOCAL_SETUP.md`.

## Infrastructure

Infrastructure provisioning is managed via Terraform in the `infra/` directory.

### Usage

1. Initialize Terraform:
    ```bash
    cd infra
    terraform init
    ```
2. Plan and apply the infrastructure:
    ```bash
    terraform plan
    terraform apply
    ```
